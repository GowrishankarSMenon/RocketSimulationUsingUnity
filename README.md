# Rocket Simulation Using Unity

## Project Overview
This is a hackathon project aimed at simulating a rocket launch using reinforcement learning in Unity. The simulation utilizes advanced techniques to model rocket behavior and environment interactions.

## Features
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Train agents to control rocket dynamics.
- **User Interface**: Provides visual feedback and metrics during simulation.

## Getting Started
